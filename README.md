### About CI/CD Scripts

This branch is solely designed for keeping, storing and updating of special scripts which are not a part of the Jersey project.
Scripts are used in CI/CD jobs on Eclipse's Infra dedicated to Jersey. Or scripts can only be backed up in this branch and do not
affect CI/CD jobs on the mentionned Infra. Helper tools are also stored here. 

### Licensing and Governance
Jersey is licensed under a dual license - [EPL 2.0 and GPL 2.0 with Class-path Exception](LICENSE.md).
That means you can choose which one of the two suits your needs better and use it under those terms.

We use [contribution policy](CONTRIBUTING.md), which means we can only accept contributions under
 the terms of [ECA][eca].
